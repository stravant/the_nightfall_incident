* Fix Grow command

* Add sounds for grow / zero / one / self-damage

* Update large screen UI

* Revisit node icons later, especially the codes one, just can't seem to find a good way to do it.

* Celular Automa node needs something in the middle to cover up where the node connections meet. Maybe it's okay if I make the node connection dot bigger to cover the junction up with that, can't think of a nice way to edit the CA node image. -> Chris will try redrawing some of the icons.

* Add a security level display somewhere maybe.

* Setup should display an error when loading fails 

Current:

Add node statistics
